# TorqueLib

Code library created by and used within FRC 1477, Texas Torque.

## Add to project

Well the easiest way is to make your new project using [TorqueTemplate](https://github.com/TexasTorque/TorqueTemplate).

But if you so insist, you can add it to an existing project using:

`git submodule add https://github.com/TexasTorque/TorqueLib	src/main/java/org/texastorque/torquelib`

## 2023 Refactor

This library, along with the Texas Torque project structure,
is being overhauled for the 2023 season. These are breaking changes.
