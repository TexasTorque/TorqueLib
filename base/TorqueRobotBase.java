/**
 * A replacment for TorqueIterative.
 * 
 * TorqueIterative was a modified version of the WPILIBJ IterativeRobot template.
 * It was created to improve upon the performance by utalizing two threads on the RoboRio.
 * However, it has neither been maintained nor updated since it's inception, and has
 * fallen out of date with the TimedRobot, IterativeRobotBase, and RobotBase standard.
 * 
 * Because of this, I (Justus) am working on a replacement class called TorqueRobotBase.
 * 
 * Although I may start working on drafts, I cannot start serious work unitl after our
 * next competition, the Texas Robotics Invitational, which we have but only 8 meetings
 * at 3 hours a piece to do way too much.
